The A2A Protocol

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol is a standardized communication framework that enables autonomous agents to interact with each other. It provides a structured way for agents to exchange messages, share information, and coordinate actions.

Key features of A2A:
- Standardized message format
- Support for asynchronous communication
- Built-in error handling
- Extensible architecture

Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol that allows AI agents to interact with language models and other AI services. It provides a standardized interface for:
- Querying language models
- Managing context and conversation history
- Accessing external tools and data sources

RAG Systems

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine information retrieval with language model generation. They work by:
1. Retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base
2. Using the retrieved context to generate informed responses
3. Providing source citations for transparency

RAG systems are particularly useful for:
- Question answering over large document collections
- Reducing hallucinations in LLM responses
- Keeping information up-to-date without retraining models
